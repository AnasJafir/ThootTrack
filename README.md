# ThootTrack
================

## Introduction
---------------

Welcome to ThootTrack, a dental clinic management system designed to help small dental clinics manage their appointments, patients, and reports efficiently. This project was inspired by the need for a digital solution in the dental industry, especially for clinics still using outdated methods like Excel.

## Inspiration and Story
-------------------------

ThootTrack was inspired by the need to bring modern solutions to small dental clinics that often rely on outdated methods like paper records and Excel sheets. As a dental student preparing my thesis to obtain a doctorate in dental medicine, I observed the operational challenges faced by my colleagues. This project aims to simplify and streamline clinic management, making it accessible and efficient.

Building ThootTrack was both a technical challenge and a learning experience. I had to navigate through various aspects of software development, from setting up databases to creating CLI-based application. One of the major challenges was ensuring data persistence and integrity across sessions. Future iterations of this project may include more advanced reporting features, integration with insurance systems, and a mobile application to make it even more accessible.

Thank you for taking the time to check out ThootTrack. I hope you find it as useful and exciting as I do!
